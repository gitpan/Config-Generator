Config-Generator

The goal of this collection of modules is to ease the generation of low-level
configuration files from high-level configuration items and templates.

The main idea is to define an abstraction of whatever needs to be generated
(for instance a messaging broker), to validate this abstraction with a strict
schema (using the Config::Validator module) and to generate all the different
files that are needed. The final files are simply generated (overwritten). If
you need to modify existing files preserving their contents, you should use
other tools such as Augeas.

This is beta software with incomplete documentation. Use it at your own risks!
